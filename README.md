# The WordPress Plugin

Integrates Fastly with WordPress' publishing tools.

## Prerequisite

The server must have "php5-curl" installed on the server you are hosting Wordpress with.

    sudo apt-get install php5-curl

## Installation

You can either install from source (you're looking at it), or from the WordPress [plugin directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/fastly/).

0. If you don't already have it send us a support request asking to have the WordPress feature turned on for your account.
1. Add a new WordPress config to a Service and set up the path to the Wordpress install. Examples:
  - If your blog is at `http://blog.example.com/`, your path is `/`
  - If your blog is at `http://example.com/blog/`, your path is `/blog/`
2. Deploy the new Version of the Service.
3. With your API key and the Service id in hand, install the plugin under WordPress.
4. Set up the Fastly plugin inside your Wordpress config panel - you should just have to input the API key and the Service id that you noted in the last step.
5. That's it! Everything should just work. :metal: If you have any problems, email us.

_Note: you may have to disable other caching plugins like W3TotalCache to avoid getting odd cache behaviour._

## What's going on?

Take a look at the inline comments in the [code](https://github.com/fastly/WordPress-Plugin/tree/master/lib) for an in depth description. But, the plugin:

- Pulls in the [Fastly API](http://docs.fastly.com/api)
- Wires Instant Purging into the publishing process, keeping content up to date
- Includes an admin panel in `wp-admin`

Using this plugin means you won't have to purge content in Fastly when you make changes to your WordPress content. Purges will automatically happen with no need for manual intervention.
